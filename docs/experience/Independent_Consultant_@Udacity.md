# DevOps Independent Consultant @Udacity

**Udacity** - *Oct 2020 - Sept 2021*

### **CICD**

- I built a **Continuous Integration & Delivery pipeline** for Machine Learning (Flask) application with Circle-CI, Git, GitHub
- I built **Blue-Green CI/CD Pipeline** with **Jenkins**, deployed, tested, monitored and maintained for containerized workloads on AWS

### **Tools & Technology used**

*Iac, Cloudformation, Jenkins, EKS, Git, GitHub, Groovy, DSL*

### **Cloud Development on AWS**

- I r**efactored** a Machine-Learning Flask application to **microservices** & deployed the application using **CircleCi & GitHub**
- I developed an image filtering API using Typescript & NodeJs & deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** with serverless framewrok
- I refactored Node.js application to **microservices,** I then **containerised** the ****application with docker and pushed the container image to dockerhub. I deployed the application on **EKS clusters** with **Travis CI** as the **continuous integration** tool and **scaled** the **microservices** application with **CPU & Memory requests**
- I **refactored** a monolith e-commerce app **to a serverless** application using serverless framework, AWS Lambda & Node.js. The image and video files were retrieved, processed and stored on **S3 bucket** while the text files, such as  item id, descriptions, purchase timestamps and amongst others were stored on **DynamoDB** as **Json objects**
- I deployed static web app on **AWS S3 bucket** and I ****created **CloudFront** as CDN for **global delivery** to users to provide best experience when accessing the pages.

### **AWS Cloud Architecture & Iac-Infrastructure as Code**

- I provisioned **Kubesphere** on the **EKS cluster with Terraform & kOps,** then, I **deployed** Drool, k6, Dapr, Apisix, Keda on **Kubesphere** using **Helm,** and maintained the infrastructure administration with **Kubesphere** web interface - created groups and users permissions
- I d**esigned** an **Elastic Infrastructure** to host social media application for 50,000 users, then I used Terraform to deployed the **Elastic Infrastructure** on **AWS, scaled** & **monitored** AWS infrastructure with **Terraform**
- I designed **Serverless Architecture infrastructure** for remote developers with proof of **Concept focus on DevSecOps** and **latency** consideration ****where I used **Amazon Incognito, Cloudfront, API Gateway**

### **Monitoring & Observability**

- **I integrated & deployed** end-to-end **distributed tracing with the Jaeger** Operator on **EKS cluster**, ****then I deployed **Kube-Prometheus** & **metrics-aggregator** on the Kubernetes **cluster** using **Helm** package manager and I **monitored & observed** kubernetes workloads with **Grafana GUI** (custom metrics-CPU & Memory)
- I t**roubleshoot** the **EKS** cluster with **distributed tracing** metrics from grafana with less efforts and efficiency

### **Security**

- I created Disaster Recovery for **EKS cluster** system with **Velero** and stored the backup files on **s3 bucket (glacia)**
- I s**ecured** Web application with **IAM policy, AWS Inspect, GaurdDuty, AWS Config, S3 encrypt**
- I recovered **Web application** with AWS S3 deletion marker & RDS **database replication**
- I **designed** and implemented **Security Architecture** as part of the DevOps lifecycle-**DevSecOps**
- I **mitigated malware** on Ubuntu 18.04 via **vulnerability testing** using **OpenVas**, **YARA**, **CVE**
- I performed **Security Audit** and risk score with DREAD model
- I implemented **RISK remediation** strategy with **bcrypt** & python using **SHA-512 algorithm**
