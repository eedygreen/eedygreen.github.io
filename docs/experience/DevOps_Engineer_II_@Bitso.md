# DevOps Engineer II @Bitso

**Bitso** - *Oct 2021 - June 2022*

- As a DevOps Engineer interfacing with developers, my focus is to understand the problems facing developers and provide good **Developer Experience**  (DevX) supports and also **identified** manual **processes** and **improved** the process through **automation**
- I improved developer experience and **tooling** through **Build, Test, Deploy** & **troubleshoot** and ****I engaged on daily **troubleshooting** & resolving **deployments** (issues with developers) ****of different **kubernetesâ€™ environments**
- I built, deployed, test, monitor, improved existing **CICD** process with **infrastructure as code.** and built Spinnaker **pipelines** for **multiple** and **production** environments ****and **Automated** Spinnaker **deployments** with GitHub webhooks
- I maintained **fault tolerant** end-to-end **CICD pipelines** for **production**(over **5 million users**)
- I designed & implemented **microservices environments** for listing **crypto-tokens** and I developed the **template** to automate **CICD** tooling, published **Java libraries** (spring & micronaut frameworks) with **GitOps** & **cookiecutter**
- I fixed one of the most commonly faced problems by developers on microservices - I resolved k8s service **health-checks** for Java (**Spring & Micronaut**) frameworks and I automated **Java build process** with **Gradle** using **GitOps**-GitHub Actions, python & bash
- Another problem that developers faced is not knowing the error before deployment. To resolve this issues, I Implemented a **continuous-testing** on **CircleCi** with **test-containers** for **crypto** microservices. I also implemented a continuous testing with GitHub actions that identified errors developers about introduce to production and suggests best practices
- I introduced **Engineering onboarding** programme as part of my Engineering strategies to improve the existing systems
- I love writing and for this reason I used my passion for writing to d**ocument** processes/user guides for **users and Engineers** on the company **confluence wiki page**
- I **collaborated** with **team members** using **Jira** to identified tech-debt and improved current processes via Sprint and Scrum
- I also created a roadmap to improved **engineering communication & organisation strategies**
